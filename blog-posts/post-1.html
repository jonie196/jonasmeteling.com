          16 Essential and Fundamental Principles to Stay in Flow and Attunement
          With Life
        </h2>
        <div class="devider-blue"></div>
        <br />
        <p class="blog-page-text">
          ✨ If you Flow with Life, Life will Flow with You.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Breath deeply. Everything and anything that happens will pass.
          Everything and anything is not against you but for you. Nothing
          happens without a reason, everything is there to help you and to guide
          you back to who you are.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ If you flow against life, life will flow against you.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Any resistance from your side will manifest as resistance from life
          against you. Not to hurt you but to reflect it back to you to teach
          you and help you to see and eventually adjust your path to a more
          aligned, peaceful, harmonious and happy state of being.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Be like a River. Be willing to change in any moment and adjust your
          path constantly. Don’t hold on to anything that naturally wants to
          leave you. Don’t block anything that naturally wants to come to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ You don’t need to change the situation you are in, the situation
          you are in is meant to change you. Change comes naturally and by
          itself when you have changed yourself.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Let life carve out your path by letting go of the need to control
          life and force your own will onto life. Let go of your controlling
          self that operates from fear and lack. Don’t judge yourself and and
          lovingly acknowledge the parts in you that don’t flow and try to
          resist, control and hold onto the past.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Embrace all of you. Be patient and trust that especially the parts
          in you that are not fully attuned are not against you but for you and
          ultimately for life! Trust that every part of yourself is beautiful
          and perfect. Trust that it is your path to love every aspect of
          yourself. Integrate the totality of who you are by lovingly seeing,
          feeling and accepting it.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Don’t live for yourself from yourself. Allow life to live through
          you. Realise yourself as an extension of life. You are life.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Open your heart especially when you want to close it.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Love deeply. Love yourself and others deeper and deeper. Be
          courageous and deepen your love and interconnectedness with everything
          and anything.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Forgive yourself and others especially if that is the last thing
          you want to do.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Serve others as you serve yourself and serve yourself as you serve
          others. What you give to others you give to yourself and what you give
          to yourself you are able to give to others as well. Serve and give to
          yourself and others as much as you can every day. Nothing gives you
          more purpose, meaning, happiness and fulfilment.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Stay innocent and open. Never hold onto any mental idea or concept,
          stay open and willing to learn, adjust, change and evolve in any
          moment. Stay alive, fresh and aware like a child.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Remember who you are. Feel your spirit and attune with your
          Transpersonal essence. Know your deepest truth. Let this knowing guide
          you. Trust nothing more than the truth of what you are. Whenever in
          doubt or fear, connect to that truth connect to your essence.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ You are here to grow, learn, heal and change. If that Realisation
          is the only thing you remember and you thrive to embody and live by
          that most fundamental principle - this by itself will guide you to
          live in purity, clarity, knowing, trust and absolute flow.
          <br />
          <br />
          ✨ Namasté, Be Blessed, Jonas✨

          Photo: I took this photo one day during my morning walk up north here
          in Canada when it was around -30 degrees and my beard started to
          freeze while at the same time beautiful sunrays came through warming
          my face.
          <br />
          <br />
          The following Principles came to me 2 nights ago during the full moon.
          I woke up at 3am and was blasted with cosmic energy. I couldn’t sleep
          for the rest of the night and wrote these lines, transmitting the
          codes of light I received that night. Very powerful teachings and
          reminders for all of us.
